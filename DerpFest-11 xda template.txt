[*]DO NOT Report bugs if you're running a custom kernel or you installed Xposed
[*]Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
[*]If it is a random reboot, grab dmesg . (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
[*]If the problem disappears after running "setenforce 0" from a root shell, grab /data/misc/audit/audit.log
[*]Remember to provide as much info as possible. The more info you provide, the more likely that the bug will be solved. Please also do not report known issues.
